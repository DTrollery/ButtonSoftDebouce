# ButtonSoftDebouce
Arduino and Rasberry Pi libraries for software based Debounced Button click classification.
The Project code is based on C++, Python.
This projects objective is to support high accuracy Software based button debouncing for a variety of devices.
It can differentiate between short, long presses and noise induced irregularities.
The code files currently support on Microcontrollers like esp32, esp8266 on arduino IDE and rasberry pi's.
